Hello! I’m **Fatemeh Doudi**, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at **Texas A&M University**, where I work under the supervision of **[Prof. Dileep Kalathil](https://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil/)**. My research focuses on **generative models**—including diffusion models, transformers, and state space architectures—with experience in RL-based fine-tuning, alignment methods, and in-context learning. 

Previously, I earned my Master’s degree from **Sharif University of Technology** in Tehran, Iran. There, I worked on **delay analysis in distributed computing** under the supervision of **[Prof. Farid Ashtiani](https://sharif.edu/~ashtianimt/)** and **[Prof. Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali](https://maddah.umn.edu/)**.

You can download my CV from **[here](Resume.pdf)**.
