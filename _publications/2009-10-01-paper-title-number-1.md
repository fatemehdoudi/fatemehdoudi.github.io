**[Diffusion Blend: Inference-Time Multi-Preference Alignment for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18547)**  
*arXiv (pre-print), 2025*

This paper proposes a method for inference-time alignment of diffusion models to multiple, possibly conflicting, user-specified preferences (rewards) without additional fine-tuning.
